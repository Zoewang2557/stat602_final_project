## A 2-level Factorial Experiment on Coagulation Time and Taste of Steamed Egg Custard

Yike Wang

**Summary:** 
A 25 unreplicated factorial experiment was carried out to explore the effects of five factors consisted in the cooking procedure on two yields: coagulation time and taste of egg custard. Egg-water ratio, type of bowl and their interaction have significant effects on coagulation time. Egg-water ratio, use of salt, water temperature, type of bowl and interaction between water and bowl have significant effects on taste. To get better taste and use less time, we should use high egg-water ratio.
